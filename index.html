        <h1>Which Team is the Greatest in NBA History?</h1>
<h2>A frequently debated topic</h2>
<p>
    We are all aware that the sweetest and most triumphant moment for any NBA team and its fans is lifting that coveted Larry O'Brien trophy.<br> 
    In the 76 years the NBA has been running 76 teams have had the liberty of calling themselves the greatest team.<br> But one question remains in our minds.
    How do these teams stack up against each other?<br>
    That is what I am going to do, compare the teams to see which team is the greatest of all time. <br>
    For purposes of simplicity, for any franchise that has won more than 1 championship, only one of the teams from the franchise will be included. I have also made the cutoff 1965 so as to limit the number of teams viable for this title.<br>
    The list of the best NBA teams is as follows:

<p>
    <h3>HONRABLE MENTION</h3>
    <i><u><h4> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969%E2%80%9370_New_York_Knicks_season" target="_blank">1969-70 NEW YORK KNICKS</a></h4></u></i>

</p>
<p>
    Considered <strong>one of the best passing teams in NBA history</strong>, this Knicks team was the <em>first to bring a championship back home</em> to New York.<br>
    Some of the stars on this team and their accolades include:
    <ul>
      <li>Willis Reed</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Seven-time NBA All-Star</li>
          <li>Five-time All-NBA selection</li>
          <li>1 MVP</li>
          <li>Two-time NBA champion (1970, 1973) and was voted the NBA Finals MVP both times.</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Walt Frazier</li>
        <ol>
          <li>7 NBA All-star appearances</li>
          <li>2 NBA Championships</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Dick Barnett</li>
        <ol>
           <li>2 NBA Championships</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Dave DeBusschere</li>
      <ol>
          <li>2 NBA championships (1970, 1973)</li>
          <li>8 NBA All-Star selections</li> 
          <li>6 NBA All-Defensive First Team selections</li>
          <li>All-NBA Second Team (1969)</li>
          <li>NBA All-Rookie First Team (1963)</li>
          <li> NBA anniversary team (50th, 75th)</li>
          <li>No. 22 retired by New York Knicks</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    Captain Willis Reed, who missed Game Six due to a torn leg muscle, hobbled onto the Madison Square Garden floor before Game Seven and scored the first two baskets to inspire the Knicks to a 113-99 victory.

    <img src="2013-14 Spurs.jpg" border="10">
</p>
<p>
    This is the only team on this list that I think lacked a true superstar. <br>Tim Duncan was at one point, but he was 37 in 2014 and past his prime. <br>Kawhi Leonard, on the other hand, was 22 and not yet in his prime. <br>However, what they lacked in star power, they made up for in depth and coaching. This team's bench had guys like Danny Green and Patty Mills as their 9th and 10th players. <br>You can't forget Greg Popvich, as there are very few coaches who I think could make a roster like this work. <br>Not only was this team able to win 62 games, but they beat (and broke up) the Big 3 Heat in just 5 games. <br>They land a little bit lower on this list because I'm not sure how they would fare going up against the other star-studded teams.<br> If all the guys on this team were in their prime, it would certainly take the #1 spot.
</p>
<p>
    <i><u><h4><b>9.</b>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970%E2%80%9371_Milwaukee_Bucks_season" target="_blank">1970-71 MILWAKE BUCKS</a> </h4></u></i>
    <img src="1970-71 Bucks.jpg" border="10">
</p>
<p>
    Kareem was only in his 2nd year in '71, but he still managed to win MVP with ease. <br>To understand how stacked this Bucks team was, you've got to understand that they had the number 1 rated defense, the scoring champion (Kareem), and 4 other players in double figures. <br>I don't know how you handle that and neither did anyone else because they ended up winning 66 games and swept the Bullets in the finals. <br>They gained extra points for only losing 2 playoff games in total and they beat a really strong Lakers team in the semi finals. Because I consider Kareem a top 3 player ever, Oscar a top 20 player ever, and their season one of the more successful on this list, it’s easy for me to put this team in the top 6.
</p>
<p>
    <i><u><h4><b>8.</b><a href=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHI/1967.html target="_blank">1966-67 PHILADELPHIA 76ers</a></h4></u></i>
    <img src="1966-67 76ers.jpg" border="10">
</p>
<p>The Philadelphia 76ers won the entire season after a perfect start in 1966–1967. <br>The Eastern Division candidate runs like a well-oiled machine, led by Wilt Chamberlain. Chamberlain, the well-known team captain, averaged 24.1 points and 24.2 rebounds per game to reach the double digits. 

    Hal Greer and Chet Walker, on the other hand, each score impressively, 19.3 and 22.1 points per game, respectively.<br> The eight-time defending champion Boston Celtics were soundly defeated 4-1 by the Philadelphia 76ers. They won the NBA title in six games against the struggling San Francisco Warriors, lifting their spirits higher than ever.

    <i><u><h4><b4>7.</b4><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DET/1989.html" target="_blank">1988-89 DETROIT PISTONS</a></h4></u></i>
    <img src="1988-89 Pistons.jpg" border="10">
    <p>
        The 1988-89 Detroit Pistons are one of the most hated teams in NBA history because of their physical style of play.<br>

However, there is no doubt that the Pistons were dominant—that surely cannot be taken away from them.<br>

The Pistons were defensively adept—and that’s an understatement. They really epitomized defensive intensity.<br>

Dennis Rodman, John Salley and Bill Laimbeer provided a strong defensive presence in the low post; they didn’t allow anyone to drive freely to the basket.<br>

Meanwhile, Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars were great perimeter defenders. In fact, Dumars was widely known as one of the only players to give Jordan trouble on the offensive end.<br>

The Pistons had multiple offensive threats too.<br>

Thomas was a great penetrator and passer. Dumars was an excellent clutch and perimeter scorer. Laimbeer was an excellent three-point shooter, while Mark Aguirre also contributed a fair number of points.<br>

The Pistons ended the '88-89 season with 63 wins and went on to defeat Larry Bird’s Celtics and Michael Jordan’s Bulls in the Eastern Conference playoffs before sweeping Magic Johnson’s Lakers in the finals.<br>

        <i><u><h4><b>6.</b><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1986.html" target="_blank">1985-86 BOSTON CELTICS</a> </h4></u></i>
        <img src="1985-86 Celtics.jpg" border="10">
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of 80s dynasties, the Celtics make their  appearance on this list at #6. <br>This team, which featured 5 players who would go on to make the Hall of Fame, ranks the highest among any of the Larry Bird Celtics teams. <br>Bird was obviously fantastic this year, averaging 26/10/7 and winning MVP.<br> Overall, these guys were a really talented group that played well together and accomplished quite a bit.<br> They have the best home record of any team ever at 40-1, with a total of 67 wins on the season.<br> I felt that they avoided playing anyone super tough in the playoffs, so I’m gonna knock them a little for that, but I don't think that takes away from them too much.<br> You know Larry Bird, you know the 80s Celtics, you know why they made this list.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><u><h4><b>5.</b><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2016.html" target="_blank">2015-16 CLEVELAND CAVALIERS</a></h4></u></i>
        <img src="2015-16 Cavs.jpg" border="10">
        <p>
            Here's the weird thing about this Cavs team: they won under 60 games and I just don't remember them being dominant like other teams on here were. <br>They're considered a borderline super-team, but we spent the entire season thinking that the Warriors were the heavy favorites.<br> Regardless, I can’t deny that they had some serious talent and deserve to be on this list.<br> Lebron, Kyrie and Love were a strong big 3 and any team with a GOAT-level player has a good chance to make this list.<br> Beating the 73-win Warriors after being down 3-1 might be the biggest accomplishment any team has ever had.<br> Maybe they weren't the favorites that year, but that's understandable when you're going against a 73 win team.<br> I still have to knock them for being dogs and winning the 2nd least games on this list, but they earned their spot here.

        </p>
        <p>
            <i><u><h4><b>4.</b><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2001.html" target="_blank"> LOS ANGELES LAKERS</a></h4></u></i>
            <img src="2000-01 Lakers.jpg" border="10">
        </p>
        <p>
            It doesn't feel right having Shaq and Kobe land here on the list, alas, this is where I have them landing.<br> The problem with picking a Shaq-KoBe team is that I don't know whether to choose the 2000 team with MVP Shaq and 67 wins or the 2001 team that went 16-1 in the playoffs but only won 56 games in the regular season.<br> I think you've got to respect the playoff run, so I picked them.<br> Outside of Shaq and Kobe, this team had more solid role players than it gets credit for.<br> Derrick Fisher, Rick Fox and Horrace Grant all could play. Add on top of that legendary coach Phil Jackson and this team is more than just the Shaq-Kobe duo.<br> The lack of regular season wins and the lack of strong competition in the playoffs forces me to put them a little lower than I want them to be.

        <i><u><h4><b>3.</b><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIA/2013.html" target="_blank">2012-13 MIAMI HEAT</a></h4></u></i>
        <img src="2012-13 Heat.jpg" border="10">
        <p>
            It seems like a disappointment that the big 3 Heat only won 2 titles.<br> Regardless, the 2013 team they put together was probably the best that they got and definitely deserves a spot on this list.<br> What made this squad so strong is that they featured arguably the best version of Lebron.<br> This was the year that he came in 2nd for DPOY and was a single vote away from being a unanimous MVP.<br> With him, Bosh and Wade leading the team, they were able to reach 66 wins and beat a very tough Spurs team in the finals.<br> The couple of knocks on this team are that they didn’t have a ton of depth and that they barely escaped losing in game 6 vs. the Spurs.<br> Wade was also out of his prime at this point, which doesn't help their case.<br> That being said, having one of the best players of all time in his absolute prime is sometimes all that really matters
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><u><h4><b>2.</b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996%E2%80%9397_Chicago_Bulls_season" target="_blank">1996-97 CHICAGO BULLS</a></h4></u></i>
        <img src="1996-97 Bulls.jpg" border="10">
        <p>
            Before the number 1 team on this list came along, this Bulls team was the unanimous best team of all time.<br> No championship team has won more regular season games than these guys. The Bulls with MJ were always a threat, but this is the year where it all came together.<br> The big 3 of Rodman, Pippen and MJ were at their peak. On top of that, Tony Kukoc had started to come into his own as well, giving them another serious scoring threat.<br> With this stacked roster they were able to manage both the highest rated offense and defense in the league this season. No one could seriously challenge them in the playoffs; they only lost 3 total games.<br> It’s pretty easy to say that this is the most successful team of all time, but because I’m taking into account other factors, they come in at #2 .<br> Still I can't understate their dominance because you don't win 72 games by accident.

            <i><u><h4><b>1.</b><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2017.html" target="_blank">2016-17 GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS</a></h4></u></i>
            <img src="2016-17 Warriors.jpg" border="10">
            <p>
                I don't think you can reasonably put any other team here as this is far and away the most talented team of all time.<br> Having 4 all stars (KD, Steph, Dray and Klay) felt like it was something out of a 2k game.<br> You could tell they were coasting in the regular season, and they still won 67 games. Once the playoffs rolled around they started going 100%.<br> They matched the '01 Lakers for the greatest postseason record in league history at 16-1.<br>

                Some people will tell you that KD didn't really fit in with what the Warriors were trying to do, but I don’t think that mattered.<br> When you have 2 players who both have a legit argument for best scorer in the NBA, there isn't going to be a team that can stop that.<br> People also forget that this team was one of the best defensive squads in the league. You could argue that another team on this list had a better season or beat better competition in the playoffs, but I'm still taking these Warriors over everyone else.
